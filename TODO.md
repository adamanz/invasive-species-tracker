# Invasive Species Tracker - Implementation TODO

## Phase 1: Environment Setup (Week 1) âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] Create Python virtual environment with required dependencies
- [x] Set up Google Cloud project and enable Earth Engine API
- [x] Configure OAuth authentication (not service account)
- [x] Create `.env` file with API keys (GCP and Anthropic)
- [x] Initialize project structure according to claude.md specifications
- [x] Set up git repository with proper .gitignore

### Phase 1 Learnings:
- Earth Engine requires OAuth authentication, not API key authentication
- Project must be registered at https://code.earthengine.google.com/register
- Use `earthengine authenticate` for initial setup
- Claude API works perfectly with anthropic package v0.52.0

## Phase 2: Core Infrastructure (Week 2)
- [ ] Implement GEE authentication module
- [ ] Create base classes for satellite data access
- [ ] Build cloud masking functions for Sentinel-2 and Landsat
- [ ] Implement vegetation index calculators (NDVI, EVI, NDWI)
- [ ] Create data export utilities for large area processing
- [ ] Set up logging system for debugging

## Phase 3: Change Detection Engine (Week 3-4)
- [ ] Develop temporal composite generation functions
- [ ] Implement baseline period analysis
- [ ] Create change detection algorithms
- [ ] Build anomaly detection for rapid vegetation changes
- [ ] Develop species-specific spectral signature matching
- [ ] Create validation framework with ground truth data

## Phase 4: Claude AI Integration (Week 5)
- [ ] Set up Anthropic client with error handling
- [ ] Create prompt templates for different analysis types
- [ ] Implement change report generation
- [ ] Build species identification module
- [ ] Develop management recommendation system
- [ ] Create result caching mechanism

## Phase 5: Visualization & Reporting (Week 6)
- [ ] Implement geemap-based interactive mapping
- [ ] Create time series visualization tools
- [ ] Build PDF report generation with maps and charts
- [ ] Develop dashboard for monitoring multiple areas
- [ ] Create export functions for GIS software compatibility

## Phase 6: Testing & Optimization (Week 7)
- [ ] Write unit tests for all core functions
- [ ] Create integration tests for full workflows
- [ ] Implement performance benchmarks
- [ ] Optimize GEE queries for large areas
- [ ] Add rate limiting for API calls
- [ ] Test with different invasive species scenarios

## Phase 7: Documentation & Deployment (Week 8)
- [ ] Create comprehensive user documentation
- [ ] Write API documentation with examples
- [ ] Develop tutorial notebooks
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Create Docker container for easy deployment
- [ ] Prepare demo with real invasive species data

## Additional Features (Future)
- [ ] Real-time alert system via email/SMS
- [ ] Web interface for non-technical users
- [ ] Mobile app for field validation
- [ ] Integration with iNaturalist for citizen science
- [ ] Machine learning model for improved detection
- [ ] Multi-language support for reports

## Research Tasks
- [ ] Compile spectral signatures for top 10 invasive species
- [ ] Research optimal temporal windows for each species
- [ ] Identify key environmental factors affecting spread
- [ ] Review latest remote sensing papers on invasive detection
- [ ] Connect with local conservation groups for validation data

## Quick Start Implementation
1. First, create and test GEE connection
2. Implement basic NDVI change detection
3. Add Claude integration for simple reports
4. Test with known invasive species location
5. Iterate and improve based on results
