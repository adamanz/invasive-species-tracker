- Timeline: Within 2 weeks

**North Entrance Corridor Intervention**
- Area: 5km stretch from North Entrance
- Details: Multiple species detected with rapid spread along roadway. Implement integrated pest management including manual removal, targeted herbicide, and installation of boot-cleaning stations.
- Timeline: Within 2 weeks

**Lamar Valley Riparian Protection**
- Area: Lamar River corridor
- Details: Invasives threatening critical wildlife habitat. Establish 100m buffer zones around water sources with intensive monitoring and rapid response protocols.
- Timeline: Within 2 weeks

#### üü° Medium Priority

**Control Spotted Knapweed spread**
- Target: Spotted Knapweed
- Details: Detected at 7 sites. Focus on early detection and rapid response.
- Timeline: This growing season

**Control Canada Thistle spread**
- Target: Canada Thistle
- Details: Detected at 5 sites. Focus on early detection and rapid response.
- Timeline: This growing season

**Dalmatian Toadflax Management**

## 5. Methodology

### Data Sources
- **Primary**: Sentinel-2 MSI Level-2A (10m resolution)
- **Analysis Period**: June-September (peak growing season)
- **AI Model**: Claude Opus for spectral pattern recognition

### Detection Approach
1. Multi-temporal spectral analysis without traditional vegetation indices

3. Spatial spread analysis using change detection algorithms
4. Validation through cross-referencing multiple detection methods

### Limitations
- Cloud cover may limit data availability in some periods
- 10m resolution may miss small infestations
- Species identification confidence varies with phenological stage
