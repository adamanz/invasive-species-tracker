## 5. Methodology

### Data Sources
- **Primary**: Sentinel-2 MSI Level-2A (10m resolution)
- **Analysis Period**: June-September (peak growing season)
- **AI Model**: Claude Opus for spectral pattern recognition

### Detection Approach
1. Multi-temporal spectral analysis without traditional vegetation indices
2. AI-driven pattern recognition for species-specific signatures
3. Spatial spread analysis using change detection algorithms
4. Validation through cross-referencing multiple detection methods

### Limitations
